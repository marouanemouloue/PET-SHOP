             Our mission is to provide dog and cat parents with everything that they need to ensure their pet lives a long and happy life. We love to talk about pets of all types and we are even more excited when you bring your furry family member into the store to meet us! We are constantly researching and learning about new products that can make our pets lives better. 

Our goal is to provide a clean, pet friendly store that has everything that your dog or cat needs. While our store is not very large, we offer an experience that is fast, friendly, local, and less expensive that the "Big Box" pet stores. 

Located in Downtown Canal Fulton, Ohio, we look to serve all Dog and Cat owners in the surrounding areas by offering a local, low cost alternative to the "Big Box" pet stores. We carry over 18 brands of Dog/Cat foods, including most major brands. toysWe also have access to many brands that are not on our shelves so, if you don't see what you are looking for, please ask about special ordering! We also have an extensive selection of toys, treats, grooming supplies, supplements and outdoor supplies that dog or cat owners may need. 

Our doors opened for the first time on September 22, 2014 and we have been growing ever since. Thanks again for visiting our site and learning about our company! We will see you soon.
